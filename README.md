## Project Overview
----
Heal-On is an all-round solution for both patients and doctors. We are working on reducing patient delay as well as focusing on health system delay too. Our project has been build upon 3 repos:
1. Patient App [Flutter]
2. Doctor Dashboard [React]
3. Backend and Database [Django]

This repo focuses on the Doctor end of our system where we let our doctors monitor their patients on a live feed and also show them the medical history of each of the patients. The key features of this end is given below
- #### Live Tracking Patients
    We let our doctors track their patients in a live feed. This live feed updates each time the patient does a test or any sort of action. This will let our doctors track their users more efficiently and take actions necessarily
- #### Storing Test History
    One of the key features of "Heal-On Doc" is to be able to store the medical history of a patient in an intuitive UI. This lets our doctors easily get an overview of the patient that they are working on 

- #### Sort Critical Patients
    The main problem about traditional treatment method is that we cannot easily sort our critical patients from the normal ones. And often the health officers are too late to know about a patient who has an emergency. We let our doctors decide who is a critical patient and sort them to a different seciton of the page. This allows us to get better monitoring of the critical patients
- #### Important Actions
    In the patients page, our doctor can take actions on a certain patient. These actions contain:
        1. Toggling Emergency
        2. Calling a Patient
        3. Setting up a test
        4. Setting an appointment
- #### Doctor Authentication
    We also have authentication for doctors so that the data of their patient remains confidential and no one other than authorized personnel can access that data

## Challenges
---
While diagnosis and treatment, both doctors and patients face some trouble that sometimes may have disastrous consequences. Some of those Challenges are :  
#### Diagnosis Delay
The time for completing diagnosis is way longer than it is supposed to be and it gives distraous results
#### Treatment Delay
There is a delay between diagnosing and seeing a doctor because it takes time to make appointments and finding a doctor
#### Tracking Critical Patients
Critical patients need more support and more care which is not always possible in traditional treatment
